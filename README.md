# Randomized Reach Out Nudger

## Motivation:

I wanted to make this project mostly as an automated tool to nudge me to keep in contact with people I've met. Friends and extended family, co-workers or people I've struck up a conversation with at various events. It is often hard to maintain relationships, especially over long distances or over time so this tool is my approach to cultivating more meaningful, deeper relationships with people.
Essentially, it consists of a spreasheet, in which you write up folks you want to be reminded to stay in touch with as well a section for various anniversaries coming up. Read below for how to set it up, make a list of contacts, schedule an email and have your own little nudge to forge better relationships.
